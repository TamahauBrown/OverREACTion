            You enter Mt. Lunaris where there are rocks many feet high, you can see it goes higher than the eye can see,
            directly in front of you is a entrance way with a circular pad made out of white marble, four statues, and
            slightly slanted stairs to the left and right of the entrance allowing people to walk into it without
            difficulty, there is a giant stone door about 10 feet high and 20 feet wide, on the left and right are the
            four elemental gods. To the left is Timat the fire god and Ramses the Earth God and to the right is Atalanta
            the air goddess and Nereid the Water goddess, on the top are two gods, to the left is the sun god Sol and to
            the right is the Moon Goddess Luna.

            You enter to a small stone room with brown stone on the ground, lit up by 2 magical lanterns, directly in
            front of you is the shape of a door in a semi circle shape of about 10 feet by 10 feet

            The second room seems to be two dragon head statues sticking out of the wall, they have glowing red eyes and
            are filling up the room with water, the water does not seem to rise though as you can see there are 6
            platforms leading directly across but Sing you remember being told of non-existant platforms being in the
            sanctum by Lady Murray and you hear the water goddess say "Only those with true sight may pass"

            You are in a long corridor with magical glowing lights illumating the path, you come across some bats who
            seem to be blocking the way
            You see three statues in front of you of fire breathing dragon statues, they are large stone statues, you
            notice the one on the right is unlit but is pointing towards a thick nest of webs, you can see there is a
            torch pillar that is unlit

            You make it into a large room with many statues of many great warriors and at the back you notice four large
            statues of the elemental gods and goddesses, you notice there are none of Sol and Luna though, to the left
            you notice is a statue of lady Murray and to the room a cracked statue where you can see light seeping out
            of it

            You see a large room with a large sun crest is the middle that is glowing and four angels on each of the
            crests diagonals, you see a connected room to your right with four angels and a moon. Sing you hear a voice
            saying "To enter the sanctum the sun and the moon need to be swapped", you see a large semi circle door
            behind the moon room

            You see, the left room there is a large statue surrounded by water but one can jump to easily and a hole in
            the ground and to the right you see 4 movable angel statues diagonal of the crest as the crest is surrounded
            by water. The left room has the shape of the sun and the right the shape of a moon. **If you move the
            statues are popping the big one into place, you notice each corner angel statue you move it changes into a
            sun shape on the right room and a moon on the left, if done the other way harmless lighting will strike on
            the player and move the statue back**

            When you go back down stairs you notice the moon room is now the sun room and vice versa, in the new moon
            room you see a portal you can enter. You enter a large room with water almost as high as you but the water
            looks pure, you see rocks the are glowing in the water, on the walls and near you. On each side of the room
            across the water are four elemental stats of water, fire, earth and air. You see Menardi and Karst grab the
            water and fire ones
