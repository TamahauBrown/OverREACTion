            Outside the Manor. The scene starts as the fighters try to exit the arena where they are approached by an
            acolyte. He is a rather tall male human, mildly fat, no hair. He is wearing purple priests robe with a
            insignia on the stomach of an arched dragon shape with wings on the outside, with three six dots inside the
            arched dragon. Three larger than the other., he has a long face mask which looks really elegant with purple
            and gold cloth.

            He shakes his head before you enter and shouts
            Priest: Infields! PREPARE TO CHARGE!
