            - I was warped into this world, taken from our own and met by a summoner who explained that we were the heroes, he told me the ritual did not fully complete so none of my other heroes arrived. The four heroes were meant to arrive. The Paladin Hero, The Cleric Hero and the Barbarian Hero but the summoning was not allowed to be done again for another week. Wandering around aimlessly I was met this shopkeeper in the alleyway, in the midst of our discussion we were interrupted by this red-haired figure named Myne, she seemed persuasive but alas she was not genuine. She attempted to steal all of my wares in an inn but luckily I was wiser than that, so I was told about the adventurer guild where I went. Spending time over 1 week I was waiting for my other associates to arrive, they eventually did and seemed a bit inexperienced so I decided to aid them.
+ We went and fought some guards in the training ground and did exceptionally well, but we lost the Barbarian Hero to unexpected events. So we adventured on
+ We went to the city square to track our lead on Mr. Vin Deisel and his "family", after finding out about who was inside the castle and what we were up against we went to the entrance of the castle to be met by this figure Bates described as "Ugly". We were victorious and attempted to enter the castle
+ Before entering the castle we met this old man who was trapped by Satania but aided us with some healing potions to assist us with our journeys. We refilled before continuing.
+ We defeated Satania's four liutenants who were all extremely resistant but nothing a Fireball couldn't stop, Rachel and Bates were exceptional in combat, nothing I had seen before
+ Finally faced against Satania's final guards we were successful but it was hard fought and as the castle was crumbling we managed to escape and save the old man and the liutenants under Satania's curse.
+ Returning all of them to the guards we received a reward of 500GP each, I decided to give them my shared halved (250GP each) and Rachel an extra 100GP totaling their earnings from the journey at:
    Bates: 780GP
Rachel: 880GP + Chronus' Mentor's Wand and Magic Broomstick
- Defeating Megumin avenged my mentor's death due to her possessed fire magic and I retrieved her wand.
- I now return to Sol content completing my objectives and investigating crime
