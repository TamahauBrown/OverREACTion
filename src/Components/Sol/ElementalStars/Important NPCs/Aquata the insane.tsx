            Aquata the Merrow was a fair lady from the town of Solgaleo, she was known as beauty. One day she was asked
            to propose to the prince of the land and she was excited to do so but alas she learned of the tragedy that
            her prince had betrayed her for another. There is a poem in the town dedicated to her "Through the sea the
            girl came sadly, something broken in her chest. She had dared to love another, but alas, no better than the
            rest. Down the stream, the girl came gladly, something opened up my doors. They longed to stop her bleeding
            heart, so we called her to our shores. Those you trust will hurt you badly, something now I'm sure you see.
            So drown your tears in me my dear, as you drown my dear, in me."

            Encounter of Aquata from the elemental star party:
            You notice magical extrasensory waves around the castle alongside tridents that seem to be glowing purple as
            if they have been magically imbued.

            The player see enscriptions that seem to be made recently by the Merrow's in the castle formerly known as
            Lunaris Castle. Pictures of a demon summoning the Merrow, and creatures from an infernal plane. Devils,
            undead such as: zombies and constructs such as: skeletons were arisen. One picture, shows a demon spawning
            three creatures in particular, human looking.
            DC5: The first a feminine figure, fair skin, beautiful as can be, has a thin figure, large breasts, long
            wavy black hair, she wears a long black dress with the dress stopping at the top of her breasts but the arms
            extending out to be gloves. One thing sticks out in particular, she has a symbol on her chest. An arched
            dragon shape with wings on the outside, with three six dots inside the arched dragon. Three larger than the
            other.
            DC10: The second seems to be a thin male figure, he wears extremely revealing black clothing, with a bandana
            on his forehead, cropped gloves and sandle shoes on his feet. His features are described as: fair skin, long
            spiked hair pointed down, with what appears to be a lighter shade used for his eyes.
            DC15: An extremely large tall figure, with wide open eyes, wears an unsleeved shirt, has an extremely large
            nose and no hair. Seems to have wires on his arms with a wrist band, wears long pants and pointed black
            shoes. This figure is shown eating at the Loxodon corpse that the demon has recently killed.

            A significantly older inscription shows the Devil creating a pendant which holds extreme power but is told
            to make the creature crazy if worn, the pendant is bound to the creature unless killed in which is flies off
            of the creature awaiting a new host. This pendant holds many mysteries and the Merrows did not seem to make
            an inscription which understands how it works, but show an arrow pointing to Aquata the beautiful.
