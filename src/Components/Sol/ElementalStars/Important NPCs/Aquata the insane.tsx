            Aquata the Merrow was a fair lady from the town of Solgaleo, she was known as beauty. One day she was asked
            to propose to the prince of the land and she was excited to do so but alas she learned of the tragedy that
            her prince had betrayed her for another. There is a poem in the town dedicated to her "Through the sea the
            girl came sadly, something broken in her chest. She had dared to love another, but alas, no better than the
            rest. Down the stream, the girl came gladly, something opened up my doors. They longed to stop her bleeding
            heart, so we called her to our shores. Those you trust will hurt you badly, something now I'm sure you see.
            So drown your tears in me my dear, as you drown my dear, in me."

            Encounter of Aquata from the elemental star party:
            You notice magical extrasensory waves around the castle alongside tridents that seem to be glowing purple as
            if they have been magically imbued.

            The player see enscriptions that seem to be made recently by the Merrow's in the castle formerly known as
            Lunaris Castle. Pictures of a demon summoning the Merrow, and creatures from an infernal plane. Devils,
            undead such as: zombies and constructs such as: skeletons were arisen. One picture, shows a demon spawning
            three creatures in particular, human looking.
            DC5: The first a feminine figure, fair skin, beautiful as can be, has a thin figure, large breasts, long
            wavy black hair, she wears a long black dress with the dress stopping at the top of her breasts but the arms
            extending out to be gloves. One thing sticks out in particular, she has a symbol on her chest. An arched
            dragon shape with wings on the outside, with three six dots inside the arched dragon. Three larger than the
            other.
            DC10: The second seems to be a thin male figure, he wears extremely revealing black clothing, with a bandana
            on his forehead, cropped gloves and sandle shoes on his feet. His features are described as: fair skin, long
            spiked hair pointed down, with what appears to be a lighter shade used for his eyes.
            DC15: An extremely large tall figure, with wide open eyes, wears an unsleeved shirt, has an extremely large
            nose and no hair. Seems to have wires on his arms with a wrist band, wears long pants and pointed black
            shoes. This figure is shown eating at the Loxodon corpse that the demon has recently killed.

            A significantly older inscription shows the Devil creating a pendant which holds extreme power but is told
            to make the creature crazy if worn, the pendant is bound to the creature unless killed in which is flies off
            of the creature awaiting a new host. This pendant holds many mysteries and the Merrows did not seem to make
            an inscription which understands how it works, but show an arrow pointing to Aquata the beautiful.

            Encounters:
            + Inner Ward: 2 Merrows patrolling the inner ward, they seem to be patrolling in a circular motion with
            their eyes fixated towards the center at all times, you notice there seems to be chained dead male human
            figures with their clothes shreaded. Roll a Charisma Saving Throw all except Rachel Sing.

            prize!

            Trap Name: Doppleganger Delusion

            Level: any

            Attack Type: You can make this an automatic effect on one PC, or you could roll an with an appropriate bonus
            vs Will for everyone in a blast 5 of the trigger, as desired.

            Description:
            Make PC(s) think that one of the others has been swapped with a doppleganger which is about to attack and
            kill them. However, there is no doppleganger — the person suspecting this has been deluded.

            Trigger:
            You can trigger this with the dying curse of a witch or a gypsy thief, or from a cursed magic item or
            scroll, or with magic runes which the party fails to disable, or whatever. You can make it unclear what the
            effect is going to be or you can give them something like “you will die at the hands of a friend”.

            Effect:
            One or more affected PCs are deluded into thinking that another PC is really a doppleganger. As DM you can
            build up some paranoia by passing notes to all the players. To the deluded PC, the note should mention that
            they notice something odd about one of the others — that his face or clothing looks slightly off or his
            voice sounds like it is changing for a moment. You can do this a few times throughout the day, increasing
            the warnings. At the same time, notes to other players could just say “continue role playing your character
            as usual… for now”. Obviously the players should not step out of character and reveal what you’ve written.
            The final part should happen at a time when the affected PC would naturally think that the others are
            especially vulnerable — perhaps most of the party is asleep or they’ve just finished a battle and some are
            injured.

            At this point, unless the deluded PC has already taken violent or other entertaining action against the
            “doppleganger”: roll a d20, consult your notes carefully, and tell him that he’s identified the threat as a
            doppleganger (and explain what that is if needed) — and that it has now dropped its disguise, drawn a
            weapon, and is about to attack an unsuspecting and defenseless comrad.

            Give the deluded PC priority in initiative and proximity to attack the suspected “doppleganger” if you can
            trick him into it! If a fight begins, you can further escalate it by having any nearby NPCs jump in on
            either side, depending where their loyalties lie.

            If the “doppleganger” is not killed at this point, the deluded PC will see the error in his judgement and
            the curse is gone. If the deluded PC manages to kill the “doppleganger” his belief is vindicated and his
            delusion strengthened. By the next day he will have identified yet another “doppleganger” amongst his
            comrads.


            Notes:
            DM NOTE: Aquata is under the influence of the Adric Prince called Molgoraun.
