            After the stories and fascination of the power of the stars, the citizens of the continent of Vale fear that
            the sanctum is too dangerous and all access to the stars must be destroyed. Some believe that the stars can
            be controlled to create a prosperous future and not lead to destruction of the land. While the debate is
            occurring in the land of Vale, the mercenary Guts has heard reports from the King Julian in the continent of
            Kalt of a deadly duo, Julian informed that he had got in contact with Rachel Murray to inform her apprentice
            Rachel Sing, Rock Stone brother Dr. Stone, a paladin by the name of Bates Mistress and a young lady name
            Seraphine to inform Onramov to all meet in the city of Aries. Guts thought this deadly duo could be
            connected to his 3 hooded figured and was eager to investigate the situation. Rachel Murray has informed
            Rachel Sing that there were 2 infamous rogues stealing the stars by the names of Menardi and Karst and to
            meet with the warriors in Aries.They were sisters in the crime causing untold destruction trying to steal
            the stars from the sanctum. Sing, being fascinated by the events, decided she would join as she was curious
            about the power the stars hold. Meanwhile in the city of Aries, a young farmer by the name of Onramov had
            heard from Seraphine about another disturbance coming, Onramov thought this might be an opportunity to save
            the world from the destruction that he had suffered, agreed to meet with the party of Rachel, Rock, Bates
            and Guts. Dr. Stone heard of the disturbance and was cautious of his brother's condition, waited until he
            was able to hear that he was not a rock, informed him of the events and Rock thought it would be in his best
            interest to join. Bates Mistress deciding that he wanted to meet his friends cause he felt like it joined
            the party.

            First plan of action the party heard was to deal with some pirates who were stealing from the city of
            Solgaleo which could be the works of Mendardi and Karst. Unfortunately in the act Guts' Sword was lost in
            the water
