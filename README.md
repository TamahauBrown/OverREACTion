## Why did I name this OverREACTion?
I have always enjoyed the React library and wanted to experiment, I have had Discord servers full of notes and related information that has become unmaintainable so I decided to make an application to put all this information and potentially will run this on a web server. 

There are 4 main worlds: Aeryaan, Sol, Kava, Serenity all with different dieties, species of origin, story, arks and more. All DM notes have been included as well! All character mentioned I do not own but have been used to participate in my session and are mentioned in honour.
